Try creating a Python program that will capture and display a personâ€™s grocery shopping list. Make it so 
the program will continually prompt the user for another item until the point where they enter a blank 
item. After all the items have been entered, try displaying the shopping list back to the user.

    groceries.append(grocery_item)
