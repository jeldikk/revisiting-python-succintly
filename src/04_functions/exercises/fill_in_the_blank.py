This exercise involves creating a fill in the blank word game. Try prompting the user to enter a noun, 
verb, and an adjective. Use the provided responses to fill in the blanks and then display the story. 

First, write a short story. Remove a noun, verb, and an adjective. Create a function that asks for input from the user. Create another function that will fill the blanks in the story youâ€™ve just created. Ensure that each function contains a docstring. After the noun, verb, and adjective have been collected from the user, display the story that has been 
created using their input.
