'''
Try to write a Python program that makes use of three variables. The variables you will use in your 
program will be animal, vegetable, and mineral. Make sure to assign a string value to each one of 
these independent variables. Your program should be able to display “Here is an animal, a vegetable, 
and a mineral.” From there, display the value for animal, followed by vegetable, and then finally 
mineral. Each one of the values should be printed on their own individual line. The output should be 
four lines in total.

animal = 'Deer'
vegetable = 'spinach'
mineral = 'aluminum'

print('Here is an animal, a vegetable, and a mineral.')

print(animal)
print(vegetable)
print(mineral)
