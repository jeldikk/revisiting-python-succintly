## these are comments in python code


## variables are named storage locations. also described as name-value pairs
vegetables = 'asparagus'

# we can change the value of variable by reassigning it. keep name of variable something meaning, so it will assist you later time when you revisit the code
vegetables = 'onion'

# variable names are case sensitive
'''
By convention, variables are usually named with all lower 
case letters, but this is by no means a requirement. While variable names can contain numbers in the 
body of the name, they must always start with a letter. Another rule to remember is that you cannot use 
a hyphen (-), plus sign (+), or other various symbols in variable names. You can however use the 
underscore (_) character
'''
Vegetable = 'Onion'
vegetable = 'onion'

# with number in between
last3Letters = 'XYZ'

# multi word variable name in snake case
last_three_letters = 'XYZ'

# multi word variable name in came case
lastThreeLetters = 'XYZ'
