## Python Testing using unittest module

This hands-on is made while learning unit testing from a youtube video from `corey schafer(Python Tutorial: Unit Testing Your Code with the unittest Module)`


### What we learnt in this tutorial video

1. Using `unittest` module to write class based unit tests for python code
2. how to run unit tests as standalone python code using below block of code
   ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
   ```
3. how to make assertions between actuals and expected values
4. how to use test wise and suite wise setup and teardown functions to employe DRY while arranging data for test cases


### What else should we learn about unit testing
1. How to mock functions to run tests in isolation
2. How to spy-on, mimic functions defined in other modules
3.
